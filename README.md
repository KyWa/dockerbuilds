# Working Environments in Docker

This idea came to me years ago from watching Jessie Frazelle talk at DockerCon on how she used containers for literally everything on her machine. It was cool at the time, but not for me as I had to run a Windows machine for work and running Docker wasn't something easily done in most environments at the time when it came to Windows host machines. With the advent of Docker Desktop and seeing Marcel Dempers doing just this I decided to get this going for myself as I tend to hop between 3 different machines at any given time and needed to keep things sane.
